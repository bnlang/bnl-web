## 📌 How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
- Use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bnlang/bnl-web/issues) page.

- Screenshots, error logs, or code snippets are highly encouraged.

### 2. Requesting Features
- Open a GitHub issue with the label `feature-request`.  
- Explain why the feature is useful and how it aligns with Bnlang’s goals (Bangla, Banglish, and English programming).

- You can help by improving clarity, translations, or adding new examples.

### 4. Contributing Code
1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.  
2. Create a new branch for your change:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-change
   ```
3. Make your changes and commit with a clear message:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add Bangla alias for WeakSet"

## ✅ Code Guidelines
- Follow existing code style (JavaScript/TypeScript, `"use strict"` enabled).  
- Add comments where necessary, especially for Bangla/Banglish alias definitions.  
- Keep functions small and focused.  
- Run tests before submitting your PR.

---

## 🧪 Testing
- Tests are located in the `tests/` directory.  
- Run tests using:  
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- New features **must** include corresponding tests.

## 🌐 Internationalization (I18n)
Bnlang supports **Bangla**, **Banglish**, and **English**.  
When contributing:
- Always add aliases in all three forms.  
- Update relevant documentation (`.mdx` files) to include examples in three languages.

## 💡 Community

- Share ideas, give feedback, and help newcomers.  
- Respectful communication is required at all times.
